From Git Bash or Windows PowerShell

##DIRECTORIES:
$dir [to find out the directory we are in]
$ls [list files within a particular directory so as to select the new directory]
$cd R [to set the directory within the R folder] 

$git clone (paste here the URL of the Repository created online with github) https://github.com/.../.../Test.git
$cd Test [change directory to the newly created folder]

$ls [list of files]
README.md [say this is the return that you get]
$vim README.md (you can also edit with Notepad by clicking on Test on the Desktop). [this is to edit the file README.md]
[after inserting (type "i") the message type ESC several times and then type ":" followed by "q" for quit without saving, or "x" for saving]
$cd ../ [Going up one folder]

##ADD:
$git add README.md [add, commit and push are the three commands necessary to get this file to github.com]
$git add . [add all untracked files]

##COMMIT:
$git commit -m "updated README file" ['m' for message]
or
$git commit -F testfile.txt ['F' for file - no need for quotes; just the name of the file]
$git log [to get an update]
$git status [... similar]

##PUSH:
$git push -u origin master ['u' is for upstream]
or
$git push [for the next time after doing the -u origin master thing]

##type when prompted "RInterested" and password
$touch testfile.txt (creates a new file in the local directory)

[Since the COMMANDS file was directly created online, we can download it by...]

##PULL:
$git pull (paste here the URL of the Repository...) https://github.com/.../.../Test.git
[If it's the first time the command to download is:]
$git clone (URL address)

##MAKE DIRECTORY, CREATE A FILE, AND UPLOAD TO GITHUB and then go the opposite direction:
$mkdir trying5
$cd trying5
$touch file.txt [touch means create a file - doesn't work on PowerShell]
On Powershell:
$notepad file.txt [there will be an error message (no such file) followed by the option to create the file]
$git init
$git add . [for everything; the name of the file instead of the dot for a specific file]
$git commit -m "I'm still trying"

[Now go to Github and create a new repository named trying5 without README. Copy to clipboard the URL (first arrow)]
$git remote add origin (paste the URL from the clipboard in here)
$git -u origin master
[and enter username and password]
[If we now make changes in Github and want to update the local directory]
[First make sure that the directory is the correct one in the local computer and then]
$git pull origin master
